In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--How many orders were placed in january
SELECT COUNT(ORDERID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--how many of those orders were for IPhones
SELECT COUNT(ORDERID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

--select customer account numbers for all orders placed in februrary
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderid;

-- whihch product was the cheapest one sold in january and what was the price
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--what is the total revenue for each product sold in january
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in february at 548 lincoln st, seattle wa 98101, how may were sold and what was the toal revenue
SELECT SUM(quantity), product,
    SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--how may customers ordered more than 2 products ata time, and what was the average amouunt spent fro those customers
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id

--list all the products sold in Los Angeles in februrary and how many of each were sold
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
WHERE Feb.quantity>2;
